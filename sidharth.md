Smith's son [Jaden Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_Smith) co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by [Steven Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Conrad) is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with [Quincy Troupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Troupe).
